# Answer Key / Marking Scheme
## For Instructor Use Only

---

## Question 1 - Marking Scheme (10 marks total)

### i. Risk Mitigation vs. Risk Transfer (2 marks)

**Key Points to Award Marks:**
- **Risk Mitigation (0.75 marks):** Managing risk through countermeasures and controls; reducing likelihood or impact
  - Example: Implementing firewall to reduce breach risk
- **Risk Transfer (0.75 marks):** Assigning risk to another entity, typically through insurance or outsourcing
  - Example: Purchasing cyber insurance or using third-party payment processor
- **Clear differentiation (0.5 marks):** Mitigation reduces risk; transfer shifts financial burden

---

### ii. Authentication vs. Non-repudiation (2 marks)

**Key Points to Award Marks:**
- **Authentication (0.75 marks):** Verifying identity of user, device, or system; proving "you are who you claim to be"
  - Example: Username/password, MFA
- **Non-repudiation (0.75 marks):** Preventing denial of action; proof that action was performed by specific party
  - Example: Digital signatures on contracts—sender cannot deny sending
- **Practical example showing both (0.5 marks):** Email with digital signature—authentication proves who sent it, non-repudiation prevents sender from denying they sent it

---

### iii. Information Security vs. Information Assurance (2 marks)

**Key Points to Award Marks:**
- **Information Security (0.5 marks):** Focuses on protecting information from security threats; primarily technical controls
- **Information Assurance (0.75 marks):** Broader scope; includes IA + non-security threats (natural disasters, recovery processes); emphasizes management, people, processes
- **Scope comparison (0.75 marks):** IA is broader—covers entire lifecycle, includes disaster recovery, business continuity; InfoSec focuses on confidentiality, integrity, availability from security threats

---

### iv. Qualitative vs. Quantitative Risk Analysis (2 marks)

**Key Points to Award Marks:**
- **Qualitative (0.75 marks):** Uses categories (High/Medium/Low); faster, subjective, good for initial assessment or non-tangible impacts
- **Quantitative (0.75 marks):** Uses numerical values (SLE, ALE); objective, precise, requires good data
- **When to use each (0.5 marks):** Qualitative for quick prioritization or when data lacking; Quantitative for investment decisions and ROI calculations

---

### v. KGIs vs. KPIs (2 marks)

**Key Points to Award Marks:**
- **KGIs (0.75 marks):** Key Goal Indicators; measure achievement of strategic goals; lagging indicators
  - Example: "Reduced incidents by 40% year-over-year"
- **KPIs (0.75 marks):** Key Performance Indicators; measure process performance; leading indicators
  - Example: "Mean time to detect: 3 hours"
- **Clear differentiation (0.5 marks):** KGIs show if goals achieved; KPIs show if processes performing well enough to achieve goals

**3. SLE After (3 marks):**
- Correct new EF identified: 0.25 (0.5 marks)
- Calculation: $15,000,000 × 0.25 = $3,750,000 (2 marks)
- Correct answer: $3,750,000 (0.5 marks)

**4. ALE After (3 marks):**
- Calculation: $3,750,000 × 0.15 = $562,500 (2 marks)
- Correct answer: $562,500 (0.5 marks)
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (0.5 marks):**
  - Annual savings: $1,350,000 - $562,500 = $787,500
  - Annual cost: $40,000 (after first year)
  - First year: $787,500 - $160,000 = $627,500 net benefit
  - Conclusion: **Yes, implement**—saves $627K year 1, $747.5K annually thereafter
