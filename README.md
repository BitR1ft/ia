## 💡 Study Tips

### General Advice:

1. **Understand, Don't Memorize:** Focus on understanding concepts, not rote memorization
2. **Use Real Examples:** Always connect theory to real-world scenarios
3. **Practice Calculations:** Do SLE/ALE calculations until you can do them in your sleep
4. **Make Flashcards:** For definitions, frameworks, and formulas
5. **Study Group:** Explain concepts to peers—teaching solidifies learning
6. **Time Management:** Practice answering questions within time limits
7. **Past Papers:** The best predictor of exam questions is past exam papers

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ **Writing too much:** Be concise and structured  
❌ **Skipping calculations:** Always show your work for partial credit  
❌ **Ignoring keywords:** "Differentiate" vs. "Explain" require different answers  
❌ **No examples:** Always provide real-world examples when possible  
❌ **Poor time management:** Don't spend 30 minutes on a 5-mark question
